          Hi, I'm Toni
        </p>
        <p class = writing-description>
          I’m a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at Stony Brook University. 
          Born and raised in Brazil with a Chinese heritage, I moved to the United States about a decade ago. 
          This diverse background allows me to speak English and Portuguese fluently, Spanish proficiently, and Cantonese conversationally.
          Growing up in two different cultures has given me a unique perspective. I’ve spent countless hours perfecting my chess skills and 
          learning new strategies. My love for sports is equally strong, with swimming standing out as my personal favorite. My passion for solving puzzles 
          and practicing sports has been with me since childhood, driving my interest in problem-solving and technology today.

      <!-- Start the about me section, this is where you left off. -->
      <!-- Currently I'm thinking about making each section a part section of my life, like the chess life, my gym life, photography, school, etc separated by each div(section) -->
