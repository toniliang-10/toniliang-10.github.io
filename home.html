          Hi, my name is Toni, nice to meet you &#129309;
        </p>
        <p class="resume-description">
          My journey as a software engineer and mathematician began when I first picked up a Lego piece from a pile in the corridor of my house and thought to myself, 
          "Can I build a house with this?" And yes, I could, and I did. But more importantly, I discovered that given enough resources, one can build anything from nothing. 
          This journey then led me to chess, where I learned tactics and various ways to find solutions to checkmating the king. I devoted years to mastering this game. 
          Today, I apply these fundamentals and my expertise in mathematics to create solutions and implement them in my career as an aspiring Software Engineer.

                As a Teaching Assistant at Stony Brook University, 
                I conducted weekly recitation sessions for both Data Structures and Algorithms and Calculus IV courses, for a total
                of 250+ students combined in both courses,
                teaching data structures, time complexity analysis, and guided students in Differential Equation
                Applications to the real world. In addition, I hosted weekly office hours, providing homework assistance 
                and exam preparation. My most enjoyable work was collaborating with professors
                to design LeetCode-inspired assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithms, and create homework assignments
                in Differential Equations with real world applications for Calculus IV.
