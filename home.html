        Hi, my name is Toni, nice to meet you &#129309;
        </p>
        <p class = resume-description>
          My journey as a software engineer and mathematician began when I first picked up a Lego piece from a pile in the corridor of my house and thought to myself, 
          "Can I build a house with this?" And yes, I could, and I did. But more importantly, I discovered that given enough resources, one can build anything from nothing. 
          This journey then led me to chess, where I learned tactics and various ways to find solutions to checkmating the king. I devoted years to mastering this game. 
          Today, I apply these fundamentals and my expertise in mathematics to create solutions and implement them in my career as an aspiring Software Engineer.

                    During my time at Staples, I troubleshot 50+ computers to fix software application anomalies and configured some of them for conventional use. 
                    In addition, I instructed more than 50 inexperienced customers on modern computers and how to use basic software. 
                    When there was no movement, I helped assemble technical devices and furniture as needed.
